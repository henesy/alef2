Alef compiler port to 9front.

Mk Notes:

$ALEF is the alef compiler for a given architecture (8al, etc.)
$ALFLAGS is the argument set for said compiler, some of the arguments for the 9front-era compilers aren't supported by the alef compilers at this time. Some /sys/src/cmd mkfiles confuse the alef compilers for this reason (mkmany). 
Known to work:

Nowhere!
